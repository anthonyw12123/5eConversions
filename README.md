# 5eConversions
This is document repo for having my conversions to 5th edition D&amp;D for things from previous editions.

## Usage
Each page is a simple html page, using the sylings found at another delightful git project, (reference). 

On linux machines, if you have python installed, hosting a super-basic http server is necessary to see these pages correctly. I do that by running

```python -B simpleHttpServer 8000```

and browsing to the right pages.
